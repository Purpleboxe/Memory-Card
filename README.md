## The process

### Built with

- HTML5

- React (Vite)
- API (Giphy)

### What I learned

This project has taught me how useEffect can be utilized such as updating an high score as well as how APIs can be integrated into projects. I had a challenge of bringing this project to github pages, but after many attempts I finally got it working.

## Conclusion

Reflecting on this project, I feel that I have a better idea of how effective React can be now that I've made a few projects with it. I can also say that this project was enjoyable to make!
